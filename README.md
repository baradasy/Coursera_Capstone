# Starbucks city mugs prediction

## IBM Data Science Specialization Capstone project
## by Sergey Timoshpolskiy, 2019

In this project I combined data from several data sources to try and predict the next cities where Starbucks would release the dedicated city mugs

The Project Report is available in _Capstone_Report.ipynb jupiter notebook and also published on [Medium.com](https://medium.com/@timoshpolsky/predicting-starbucks-city-mugs-591170fc62eb)

Other notebooks in the repository contain python code used to perform data analysis, visualizations and preditcions.

Interestingly, although this project was just a way to get some hands-on Data Science experience, from the 10 release-candidate mugs I had predicted, two were actually released by Starbucks in the following year:

- Bangalore, India
- Cape Town, South Africa
